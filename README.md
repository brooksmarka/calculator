Calculator takes input and delivers the result

Within the command line type "ruby calculator.rb"

You will then be prompted to enter your expression. ie "3+4-5*4"

The calculator will deliver the result without order of operations from evaluating from left to right

Current version will calculate within parenthesis but not evaluate the remaining values
